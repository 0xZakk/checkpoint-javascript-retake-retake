// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations

// Define a `Playlist` class with the following properties:
// - a `title` property that is a string determined by some input (passed into the constructor)
// - a `songs` property that is an empty array not determined by input (not passed into the constructor)
// - an `addSong` method that adds a song (string) to the `songs` array



// Create an instance of the Playlist class and set it to a variable called `myPlaylist`
// Call the instance's `addSong` method to add a song to the instance's `songs` array




// NOTE: THE CODE BELOW IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES. DO NOT REMOVE OR ALTER.
if(typeof Playlist !== 'undefined') {
  module.exports = {
