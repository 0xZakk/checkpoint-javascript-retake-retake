// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations

// #1: Define a `Student` class with the following properties:
// - a `name` property for their first and last name
// - a `course` property for the class they're a student in
// - a `grade` property for their grade in the class
// - a `graduate` method that sets the `grade` property to the string `A+`
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

class student {name; course; grade; graduate}

constructor = student(
  this.name = first, name,
)

constructor = student(
  this.graduate = "A+",
)

// #2: Create an instance of the Student class and set it to a variable called `myStudent`

constructor = student(
  this.myStudent = myStudent,
)


// Call the instance's `graduate` method to set the student's grade to an 'A+'
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
