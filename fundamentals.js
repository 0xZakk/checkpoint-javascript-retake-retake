// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations.

// #1: Create an array of strings called `foods` that contains three foods.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var foods = ["apples", "oranges", "cookies"];

// #2: Access the last item in the array and assign to a variable called `last`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var last = foods[2];

// #3: Create an empty array called `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var favoriteFoods = [];

// #4: Create a `for` loop that adds each string in `foods` to `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

for (i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) {
  favoriteFoods[i] = foods[i];
}


// #5: Create an object literal called `instructor` that contains three key-value pairs.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var instructor {
    constructor (name, subject, location) =>
    name: "James";
    subject: "Art";
    location: "VI"
    }; 
    

// #6: Add a `has-office-hours` (spelled exactly) property to `instructor` by accessing
// it (do not change the original object you typed above) and assigning it
// a boolean value.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
instructor.has-office-hours: "true"
